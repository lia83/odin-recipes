Odin Project Recipes Project
This project is the first HTML project assigned in The Odin Project.
It involves the creation of a basic webpage with a few links.
So far I have learned how to set up a GitHub repository, clone to my local machine, and navigate to the folder using Terminal. 
I am using VS Code to update this README file.
